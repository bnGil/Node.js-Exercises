//? Three things that Node.js has and the client side JS doesn't have and why:
// 1) global object -
// 1) process object - to deal with the node process that is running.

//? Three things that client side JS has and the Node.js doesn't have and why:
// 1) window object - because in the client side there is an actual window to work with
// 2) document object - to do DOM manipulation on the browser. in the node we don't do DOM manipulation so we don't need that object
// 2) fetch - We don't have fetch on node. We can use axios though.
